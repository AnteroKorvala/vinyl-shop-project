/*
This vinyl record component was inspired by the artwork of one Ana Tudor: https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/kNqgKO (@thebabydino on Codepen -> https://codepen.io/thebabydino).
They had made this cool vinyl record purely using CSS and we thought it fit perfectly with the theme of our project.
We added some extra flair to it by modifying the code a little and giving it a spinning animation and making it a little wobbly, similiar to a real vinyl record.
We got the inspiration for this animation from the amazing CSS loaders that one Temani Afif makes -> https://dev.to/afif/i-made-100-css-loaders-for-your-next-project-4eje.
